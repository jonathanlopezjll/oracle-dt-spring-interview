# Instructions

We need to review this Spring based microservice, which will run in a k8s cluster and provide this "Zillow" like functionality.

This is a very open kind of review, we'd like you to check the code and narrate what you see, mentioning

* What you know
* What you like / dislike
* What you would improve / add / change
* What is missing
* What questions you'd have for the owner
* What would be the bar for merging

Start with the [README](./README.md) for more info and then dive into the code.
